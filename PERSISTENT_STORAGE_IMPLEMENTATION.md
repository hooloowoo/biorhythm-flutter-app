# Biorhythm App - Persistent Storage Implementation

## Overview

The Biorhythm Calculator app now includes persistent storage for the user's birthday using the `shared_preferences` package. This ensures that the user's selected birthday is automatically restored when the app is restarted.

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies Added
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - Flutter plugin for reading and writing simple key-value pairs to persistent storage

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Birthday Persistence**: When a user selects their birthday, it's automatically saved to the device's persistent storage.

2. **Automatic Restoration**: When the app starts, it automatically loads the previously saved birthday from storage.

3. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and web platforms.

### Technical Implementation

#### Storage Methods
```dart
// Save birth date to persistent storage
Future<void> _saveBirthDate(DateTime birthDate) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  await prefs.setString('birth_date', birthDate.toIso8601String());
}

// Load birth date from persistent storage
Future<void> _loadBirthDate() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final birthDateString = prefs.getString('birth_date');
  if (birthDateString != null) {
    setState(() {
      _birthDate = DateTime.parse(birthDateString);
    });
  }
}
```

#### App Lifecycle Integration
- **`initState()`**: Calls `_loadBirthDate()` when the app starts to restore the saved birthday
- **`_selectBirthDate()`**: Calls `_saveBirthDate()` whenever the user selects a new birthday

#### Data Format
- Birthday is stored as an ISO 8601 string format (e.g., "1990-05-15T00:00:00.000")
- Storage key: `'birth_date'`

### User Experience

1. **First Use**: User selects their birthday → automatically saved
2. **Subsequent Uses**: App starts → birthday automatically restored → user can immediately see their biorhythm analysis
3. **Change Birthday**: User selects a new birthday → old data is replaced with new birthday

### Platform-Specific Storage Locations

- **Android**: SharedPreferences
- **iOS**: NSUserDefaults
- **macOS**: NSUserDefaults
- **Windows**: Registry
- **Linux**: LocalStorage
- **Web**: localStorage

### Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: No need to re-enter birthday every time
- **Faster App Usage**: Immediate access to biorhythm calculations on startup
- **Data Persistence**: Birthday is retained even after app updates or device restarts
- **Privacy**: All data is stored locally on the user's device

### Build Compatibility

The persistent storage implementation is fully compatible with:
- ✅ Debug builds (`flutter build apk --debug`)
- ✅ Release builds (`flutter build apk --release`)
- ✅ Play Store AAB builds (`flutter build appbundle --release`)
- ✅ All supported platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, Web)

## Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified to work correctly in both debug and release modes. The app builds successfully for all target platforms and maintains backward compatibility.
